# Library-Mgt
I created this simple library management system to handle basic CRUD operations for a librarian.
Tkinter GUI library was used for its simple user interface that allows to display, insert and delete data.
Pyodbc was used to connect the UI with the MS Access database and perform the relevant operations.
It was a programming fundamentals assignment in my first semester (2022).
